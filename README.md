# SIMIL

Welcome to SIMIL! This is an old collection of R Scripts written to handle Structure (a program known by all Molecular Ecologists) outputs; notably to export data and compare datasets among each other.

The package was described in a publication:
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1755-0998.2007.02076.x/full

(thanks for citing this paper if you use SIMIL).


Contents:
- SIMIL.collection.r : the R scripts, to be sourced in your R console (Windows users will have a functional GUI).
- SIMIL_manual.pdf   : RTFM
- data/ : some inut files to play around.


NB. This project is finished and will not evolve much in a near future.
